#bf-krumo

This is a simple WordPress plugin that includes the [Krumo](http://krumo.sourceforge.net/) `print_r()` and `var_dump()` replacement tool. This plugin was inspired by the [Devel Project](https://drupal.org/project/devel) for Drupal, but with none of the additional functionality.

##Using bf-krumo

Once installed, call `krumo()` in your code whenever you need to output some variables.
